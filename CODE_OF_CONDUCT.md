Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Project whether it be online or face-to-face. This includes project code, code repository, associated web pages, documentation, mailing lists, project websites and wiki pages, issue tracker, meetings, telecons, events, project social media accounts, and any other forums created by the project team which the community uses for communication. In addition, violations of this Code of Conduct outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
Community Responsibilities
Everyone in the community is empowered to respond to people who are showing unacceptable behavior. They can talk to them privately or publicly. Anyone requested to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If the behavior continues concerns may be brought to the project administrators or to any other party listed in the Reporting section below.
Project Administrator Responsibilities
Project Administrators are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are encouraged to model appropriate behavior and provide support when people in the community point out inappropriate behavior. Project administrator(s) are normally the ones that would be tasked to carry out the actions in the Consequences section below.
 
Project Administrators are also expected to keep this Code of Conduct updated with the main one housed at UCAR as listed below in the Attribution section.
Reporting
Instances of unacceptable behavior can be brought to the attention of the project administrator(s) who may take any action as outlined in the Consequences section below. However, making a report to a project administrator is not considered an ‘official report’ to UCAR.
 
Instances of unacceptable behavior may also be reported directly to UCAR via UCAR’s Harassment Reporting and Complaint Procedure at https://www2.fin.ucar.edu/procedures/hr/harassment-reporting-and-complaint-procedure, or anonymously through UCAR’s EthicsPoint Hotline at https://www2.fin.ucar.edu/ethics/anonymous-reporting. 
Complaints received by UCAR will be handled pursuant to the procedures outlined in UCAR’s Harassment Reporting and Complaint Procedure. Complaints to UCAR will be held as confidential as practicable under the circumstances, and retaliation against a person who initiates a complaint or an inquiry about inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated.
 
Any Contributor can use these reporting methods even if they are not directly affiliated with UCAR. The Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page for reporting is here: https://www2.fin.ucar.edu/procedures/hr/reporting-faqs.
